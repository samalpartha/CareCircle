## 📈 **ANALYTICS - TRACK PROGRESS**

**Purpose**: Understand patterns, measure outcomes, see trends

### **Overview**

Analytics helps you answer:
- Is Mom's medication adherence improving?
- Are cognitive symptoms getting worse over time?
- How effective are our interventions?
- Which family members are doing the most?

### **Key Metrics (Top Cards)**

```
┌───────────────┐  ┌───────────────┐  ┌───────────────┐  ┌───────────────┐
│ 📊 Task       │  │ ⏱️ Avg        │  │ 👥 Active     │  │ 📋 Total      │
│  Completion   │  │  Response     │  │  Family       │  │  Tasks        │
│     Rate      │  │  Time         │  │  Members      │  │              │
│    87%        │  │   4.2 hours   │  │      5        │  │     142       │
└───────────────┘  └───────────────┘  └───────────────┘  └───────────────┘
```

**What each means**:
- **Task Completion Rate**: % of tasks completed on time (higher is better!)
- **Avg Response Time**: How quickly family responds to alerts
- **Active Family Members**: How many people are helping
- **Total Tasks**: All tasks created (shows engagement)

### **Charts & Visualizations**

**1. Task Distribution (Pie Chart)**
```
Shows: Who's doing what?
Example:
  • Sarah: 35% (medication checks)
  • Mike: 25% (transportation)
  • Lisa: 20% (financial)
  • John: 20% (home maintenance)
```

**2. Behavioral Trends (Line Chart)**
```
Shows: Are things improving or declining?
X-axis: Time (last 30 days)
Y-axis: Number of incidents

Two lines:
  • Tasks (green line)
  • Alerts (red line)

What you want to see:
  ✅ Alerts trending DOWN (fewer concerns)
  ✅ Tasks stable or trending down (becoming routine)
```

**3. Intervention Effectiveness (Bar Chart)**
```
Shows: Which actions worked?

  Resolved    ████████████ 65%
  Pending     ██████ 25%
  Escalated   ██ 10%

Good outcome: >60% resolved
```

### **Time Range Selector**

Toggle between:
- **Week**: Last 7 days (detailed view)
- **Month**: Last 30 days (trends)
- **Year**: Last 12 months (long-term patterns)

### **How to Use Analytics**

**Weekly Review** (10 minutes):
1. Check completion rate (goal: >80%)
2. Look at trend lines (alerts going up or down?)
3. Review distribution (is workload fair?)
4. Adjust based on insights

**Red Flags to Watch**:
- ⚠️ Completion rate dropping below 70%
- ⚠️ Response time increasing (means burnout?)
- ⚠️ Alerts trending upward consistently
- ⚠️ One person doing >50% of tasks (unsustainable)

**Green Flags (Good!)**:
- ✅ Completion rate >85%
- ✅ Alerts decreasing over time
- ✅ Response time consistent or improving
- ✅ Tasks evenly distributed
